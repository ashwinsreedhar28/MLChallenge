This is my Machine Learning (ECE 50024) Mini Challenge Code.

There are 3 files (in order that they are run):
1. crop_images.py - to crop the training and testing images
2. model_utility.py - contains the Transformer model and the training loop
3. validation.py - uses trained transformer on the test dataset.
